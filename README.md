# Full Stack "Keeper" Notepad Application

This project was created by Rhys Talley using React.

## Functionality

A notepad web app where notes can be stored and retrieved through a database on MongoDB. Users have the option to create notes and delete notes, and these changed will be reflected in the database.

## Running the software

Ensure you have Node.js and React installed on your computer. Check this with  `node --version` and `npm --version`. You will likely have to reinstall the dependencies, so delete the `package-lock.json` files from both the frontend and backend files, and reinstall them using `npm install`. Then, run `npm start` in both the frontend and backend directories to run the application.
